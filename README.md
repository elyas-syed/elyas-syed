# Hi, I’m Elyas! 👋

Cloud Architect | DevOps & Open Source   
AWS • Azure • Kubernetes • Terraform • GitOps • Automation

Hi, I’m Elyas! I enjoy helping organizations modernize their infrastructure, simplify complexity, and turn technical challenges into practical, reliable solutions. I design and build secure, scalable cloud platforms using AWS and Azure, with a strong focus on Kubernetes, Terraform, infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and automation.

I’m also an **open source enthusiast** who enjoys learning by building, experimenting, and contributing where possible.

## 🔧 What I Work On
- Cloud architecture across AWS and Azure environments  
- Kubernetes platforms and container orchestration (EKS, GKE, AKS)  
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and CloudFormation  
- CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, and deployment automation  
- Configuration management and automation with Ansible  
- Cloud security, monitoring, and reliability-focused design  
- Exploring AI/ML and cloud-native AI workloads through hands-on projects
